# AIOC
A short project on how to enable the DTR on the AIOC in windows using simple codes. I have a few Powershell lines and an entire C# project to share. 

Users will be able to talk through the AIOC using a basic HT and Windows. Once I get my project neatly coded for sharing I can show you how to record using NAUDIO and other Windows Core API to enable stratetic recording with no blank spaces(pauses) enabled. 

Also included are a hotkey and hold to PTT button set with indicator. A TTS(Text-To-Speech) writer and a COMM Port selector. In order to fully grasp the basic usages of the AIOC in Windows I added a few sound bars and a digital volume meter which can be paused. The clock rate for recording buffers and the squelch for monitoring and precision volume can also be set.


[I got the ideas and basic code blocks from PTT-DTRmaster... I can't find the link]

Useful is the VB 16 Channel Cable (VBCABLE) https://vb-audio.com/Cable/

Using the hide function -> Light turns on when receiving and records -> Indicators also display hotkey being used to PTT.

 (CHANNEL MODE!)

The red light turns on.
