# AIOC
2025 Dec: This project is still being worked on and improved. Created in C# Designer Visual Studio. Currently the project has expanded in functionality with working playback features, an FFT display, and other safety to sound/RF considerations for codes. 

A short project on how to enable the DTR on the AIOC in windows using simple codes.

Improvements as of Dec. 2025. 
(Windows Voice Recognition sucks! I probably clean up much of that)

Sorry the audio sucks I was trying to use a OBS and haven't figured out how to record without all the sounds at once! Lol I'll get it together...

*Here is the fundamental concept to programming in Windows that will enable the AIOC to PTT (via DTR functions).

*I originally got the idea from this project and went ahead and made things work my own way.

*In time... I'll be able to share the actual codes but for now you should just use the link until I open source. 
**Use this cable instead of any just any other charging or data cable...its for a good reason. The AIOC chip is commonly complained for shorting up and locking TX. This cable prevents 100% of that. I use it for my car, drone, and radio where cables normally are going to suck.
