# AIOC
2025 Dec: This project is still being worked on and improved. Created in C# Designer Visual Studio. Currently the project has expanded in functionality with working playback features, an FFT display, and other safety to sound/RF considerations for codes. 

A short project on how to enable the DTR on the AIOC in windows using simple codes.

Improvements as of Dec. 2025. 
(Windows Voice Recognition sucks! I probably clean up much of that)

Sorry the audio sucks I was trying to use a OBS and haven't figured out how to record without all the sounds at once! Lol I'll get it together...
